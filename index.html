<h1>Join The DOTS: Democracy On The Streets</h1>

<h2>Welcome to dotZero</h2>
	<p>dotZero is symbol and centre for <strong>Join The DOTS: Democracy On The Streets</strong>. </p>
	<p>Like <strong>Join The DOTS</strong>, dotZero is being cobbled together from
	<a href="https://theintercept.com/2020/03/16/coronavirus-capitalism/" target="_blank">ideas lying around</a>. And Mwe're new to coding. </p>
	<p>Importantly, <strong>Join The DOTS</strong> is <em>emerging</em>. dotZero is it's 'placeholder': a freshly-minted space
	that will be increasingly elaborated and refined, over time.</p>
	<p> MWe invite you to check in regularly.
	<p>And MWe seek your input.
 	<p>MWe also incite you to <strong><em>Join the DOTS</em></strong>. </p>

	<h2>About <em>Join the DOTS</em></h2>
	<p><strong>Join The DOTS</strong> is emergent phenomenon. It is game-like, but resistant to categorisation.</p>
	<p>It can be described as <strong><em>a global, chalk-based, wellbeing movement</em></strong>, or collaboration.</p>

<h2>Purpose</h2>
	<p><strong>Join the DOTS</strong> exists to return voice and agency to the street. </p>
	<p>It aims to empower ordinary people and expand democracy. </p>
	<p>Ultimately, <strong>Join The DOTS</strong> seeks to serve as ‘connective tissue’.
	<p> It works to <strong>integrate</strong> superficially disparate ideas and causes into a coherent
	whole, capable of capturing and inspiring our individual and collective imaginations.</p>

<h2>Rationale</h2>
	<p><strong>Join the DOTS</strong> insists that the
		<a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2016/11/28/einstein-circles-of-compassion/" target="_blank">optical
	delusion</a> of a 'self' defined by separateness from the rest of the universe simply does not cut it any more.</p>
	<p>It is now obvious that our own personal wellbeing is delimited by the wellbeing of the world we are a part of.</p>
	<p>Acknowledging this, dedication to improving the welfare of others and of the planet becomes a matter of enlightened
	self-interest.</p>
	<p>This view is not so radical.</p>
	<p>What <em>is</em> radical is our departure from this truth via a current cultural pattern of escalating extraction,
	exploitation, and atomisation.</p>
	<p>The dominant political and cultural values of past decades no longer serve.</p>
	<p><strong>Join the DOTS</strong> believes MWe urgently need a
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inventing_the_Future:_Postcapitalism_and_a_World_Without_Work" target="_blank">new hegemony</a>
	, or common sense.</p>
	<p>And MWe consider the arena of <em><strong>the self</strong></em> expansive
	enough, meaningful enough, and resonant enough, to contain <strong>all</strong> the myriad
	struggles for a just world.</p>
	<p>We put forward 'MWe' - a term that integrates and honours both the 'me' and the 'we' - as a sufficient meme around which the
	new and transformative common-sense can coalesce.</p>


<h2>Method</h2>
	<p>The medium is the message. Pavement chalk is both practically and symbolically optimal as a
means of communication and to legitimately claim space.</p>

<h2>How To Play</h2>
<p>Put simply, <strong>Join The DOTS</strong> is about putting chalk to pavement and saying what's on your mind.<p>
<p>It is about 'learning by doing' and makes the most sense when practiced.</p>

 			<li>Play safe. Play social.</li>
 			<li>Chalk with an open heart and mind.</li>
 			<li>Use the simplest of chalks. Pavement chalk is ideal.</li>
			<li>Chalk openly. Claim your space.</li>
			<li>Include a Unifying Meme</li>
			<li>Whenever possible, leave some chalk behind. It's a conversation!</li>
		</ul>

<h2>Unifying Memes</h2>
	<p>The Unifying memes are those  symbols and phrases which, when inscribed in chalk, gently link any
	individual expression to the broader frame of <strong>Join the DOTS</strong>. </p>
	<p>Unifying memes include: </p>
		<ul>
 		 	<li>the dotZero symbol</li>
 			<li>the phrase 'Join the DOTS'</li>
			<li>the phrase 'Democracy On The Streets'</li>
 			<li>the word 'Eternity'</li>
 			<li>the word 'Infinity'</li>
			<li>the pronoun 'MWe'</li>
			<li>InfinityDOTS (two dots, side by side, different colours)</li>
		</ul>
	<p>Sometime, somewhere, a single chalk dot might suffice.</p>

		<h2>Long Game Memes</h2>
			<p>Long game memes are where alchemy and creativity kick in.</p>
			<p>There are no specific 'rules'. </p>
			<p>Long Game Memes can be anything from rainbows to rants, scribblings to slogans</p>
			<p>Their overall strategic purpose is to encourage participation, expand the democractic space and prompt, promote and provoke new thinking.</p>
			<p>Long Game Memes are what ensure the ideas lying around belong to the community.</p>

<h2>Who are MWe?</h2>
	<p><strong>Join The DOTS</strong> coalesced in the mind of a single individual during a period of COVID
	lockdown. </p>
	<pBut it is informed by a multitude of
	perspectives. <p><a href="https://clarionalleymuralproject.org/william-gibsons-agency-chapter-33-clarion-alley/">William Gibson</a> might call it a
	‘Branch Plant of MWe’. </p>
	<p>In any case, it is appropriate to say it is authored by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uo8Yo4UE6g0" target="_blank">MWe</a>. </p>

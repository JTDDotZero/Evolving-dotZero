<h1>Join The DOTS: DemocracyOnTheStreets</h1>
<h2>Welcome to dotZero</h2>
	<p>dotZero is symbol and centre for Join The DOTS: DemocracyOnTheStreets.</p>
	<p>Like Join The DOTS, dotZero is iterative and evolving.</p>
	<p>MWe invite you to check in regularly</p>
 	<p>MWe also invite you to Join the DOTS</p>
<h2>About Join the DOTS</h2>
	<p>Join The DOTS is emergent phenomenon. It is game-like, but resistant to categorisation.</p>
	<p>It can be described as a global, chalk-based, wellbeing movement – or collaboration.</p>
<h2>Purpose</h2>
	<p>Join the DOTS exists to expand available space for human voice and agency; dialogue;
	imagination; and, a fuller sense of ‘the self’. </p>
	<p>In particular, Join The DOTS seeks to provide ‘connective tissue’: to link the myriad
	attempts to realise a more just, sustainable and satisfactory way of being in the world,
	through an expanded sense of self and a subsequent shared perception of ‘enlightened
	self-interest’. </p>
<h2>Rationale</h2>
	<p>Join the DOTS believes that the <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2016/11/28/einstein-circles-of-compassion/">optical
	delusion</a> of the self as separate from the rest of the universe simply does not cut it any more.</p>
	<p>It is now obvious and inescapable that our fates are intertwined and our individual and
	collective wellbeing are inseparable.</p>
	<p>From this it follows that a more just and equitable world is a matter of urgent self-interest
	for everybody.</p>
	<p>Join the DOTS believes that this universal frame – of untimate self-interest – is expansive
	enough, meaningful enough, and resonant enough, to encapsulate and connect all the myriad
	impulses to justice currently swirling throughout the ether.</p>
	<p>MWe believe developing a conceptual frame to connect all our efforts is both appropriate and
	essential to establishing a new common sense, or hegemony, capable of uniting and inspiring
	humanity to respond appropriately to our profound and existential challenges.</p>
<h2>Method</h2>
	<p>The medium is the message. Pavement chalk is both practically and symbolically optimal as a
	tool to engage and unite generations in a creative endeavour of imagination, and to legitimately
	claim space.</p>
<h2>How To Play</h2>
	<p>Like all good games, he rules are simple but the potential permutations infinite.</p>
		<ul>
 			<li>Play safe. Play social.</li>
 			<li>Chalk with an open heart and mind.</li>
 			<li>Use the simplest of chalks. Pavement chalk is ideal.</li>
			<li>Chalk openly. Claim your space.</li>
			<li>Include a Unifying Meme</li>
			<li>Whenever possible, leave some chalk behind. It's a conversation!</li>
		</ul>
<h2>The Unifying Memes</h2>
	<p>The Unifying memes are those  symbols and phrases which, when inscribed in chalk, gently any
	individual expression to the broader frame of Join the DOTS.</p>
	<p>Unifying memes include: </p>
		<ul>
 		 	<li>dotZero symbol</li>
 			<li>Join the DOTS</li>
			<li>Democracy On The Streets</li>
 			<li>the word 'Eternity'</li>
 			<li>the word 'infinity'</li>
			<li>the word 'MWe'</li>
			<li>InfinityDOTS (two dots, side by side, different colours)</li>
		</ul>
	<p>One day, ideally, a single chalk dot might suffice.</p>
<h2>Why Connect to Join the DOTS?</h2>
	<p>While join the DOTS is iterative, changeable and learning as it goes, certain values are
	encoded deep into its DNA. These touch on issues of the self, free expression, community,
	democracy, enquiry, outreach, connection and transformation.</p>
	<p>If these values resonate with you, please Joini the DOTS.</p>
	<p>MWe need you. Really.</p>
<h2>Who are MWe?</h2>
	<p>Join The DOTS coalesced in the mind of a single individual (me) during a period of COVID
	lockdown. </p>
	<p>The moment of epiphany was realising DOTS was an acronym for Democracy On The Streets. </p>
	<p>This realisation opened the floodgates and the concept has been eminently generative,
	intrinsically rewarding, and kinda weird, ever since. </p>
	<p>While Join The DOTS did indeed surface in my individual mind, it is informed by a host of
	disparate experiences and perspectives. William Gibson might consider it the product of a
	‘Branch Plant of MWe’. </p>
	<p>In any case, it is appropriate to say it was originated from, and is being authored by, MWe.</p>
	<p>MWe invite and encourage you to participate in its further realisation.</p>

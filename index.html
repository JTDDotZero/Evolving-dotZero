<h1>Join The DOTS: Democracy On The Streets</h1>

<h2>Welcome to dotZero</h2>
	<p>dotZero is symbol and centre for <strong>Join The DOTS: Democracy On The Streets</strong>. </p>
	<p>Like <strong>Join The DOTS</strong>, dotZero is being built from the ground up. And Mwe're new to coding. </p>
	<p>Importantly, <strong>Join The DOTS</strong> is <em>emerging</em>. dotZero is it's 'placeholder': a freshly-minted space
	that will be increasingly elaborated and refined, over time.</p>
	<p> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NMWAczkhGg" target="_blank">MWe</a>
	invite you to check in regularly. <p>And MWe seek your input.
 	<p>MWe also invite you to <strong><em>Join the DOTS</em></strong>. </p>
	<p>Above all, that means putting chalk to pavement and saying what's on your mind.<p>
	<p><strong>Join The DOTS</strong> is about action and makes the most sense when practiced.</p>
<h2>About <em>Join the DOTS</em></h2>
	<p><strong>Join The DOTS</strong> is emergent phenomenon. It is game-like, but resistant to categorisation.</p>
	<p>It can be described as <strong><em>a global, chalk-based, wellbeing movement</em></strong>, or collaboration.</p>

<h2>Purpose</h2>
	<p><strong>Join the DOTS</strong> exists to return voice and agency to the street. </p>
	<p>It aims to empower ordinary people and expand democracy. </p>
	<p><strong>Join The DOTS</strong> is ‘connective tissue’.
	<p> It seeks to <strong>integrate</strong> the countless ideas and demands for justice into a coherent
	whole capable of capturing and inspiring our individual and collective imaginations.</p>

<h2>Rationale</h2>
	<p><strong>Join the DOTS</strong> insists that the
		<a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2016/11/28/einstein-circles-of-compassion/" target="_blank">optical
	delusion</a> of a 'self' defined by separateness from the rest of the universe simply does not cut it any more.</p>
	<p>Everyday lifeworld events increasingly demonstrate that our fates are intertwined and our individual and
	collective wellbeing are ultimately inseparable.</p>
	<p>Acknowledging this, it becomes apparent that our own <strong>personal</strong> wellbeing is integrally linked to, and dependent upon, our <strong>collective</strong>
	wellbeing.</p>
		<p>From this perspective, dedication to a lifeworld defined by universal justice, compassion and care
		becomes a matter of enlightened self-interest.</p>
	<p>This view is not so radical.</p>
	<p>What <em>is</em> radical is our departure from this truth via a current cultural pattern of escalating extraction, exploitation, and atomisation.</p>
	<p><strong>Join the DOTS</strong> believes <strong>MWe</strong> - urgently need a new hegemony, or common sense.</p>
	<p>And MWe consider 'MWe' a term that integrates and honours both the 'me' and the 'we' - a sufficient meme around which the
	new and transformative common-sense could coalesce.</p>

	<p><strong>Join the DOTS</strong> considers the arena of <em><strong>the self</strong></em> expansive
	enough, meaningful enough, and resonant enough, to contain <strong>all</strong> the myriad
struggles for a just world.</p>

<h2>Method</h2>
	<p>The medium is the message. Pavement chalk is both practically and symbolically optimal as a
means of communication and to legitimately claim space.</p>

<h2>How To Play</h2>
	<p>Like all the best games, the rules are simple but the plays are infinite.</p>
		<ul>
 			<li>Play safe. Play social.</li>
 			<li>Chalk with an open heart and mind.</li>
 			<li>Use the simplest of chalks. Pavement chalk is ideal.</li>
			<li>Chalk openly. Claim your space.</li>
			<li>Include a Unifying Meme</li>
			<li>Whenever possible, leave some chalk behind. It's a conversation!</li>
		</ul>
<h2>Unifying Memes</h2>
	<p>The Unifying memes are those  symbols and phrases which, when inscribed in chalk, gently link any
	individual expression to the broader frame of <strong>Join the DOTS</strong>. </p>
	<p>Unifying memes include: </p>
		<ul>
 		 	<li>the dotZero symbol</li>
 			<li>the phrase 'Join the DOTS'</li>
			<li>the phrase 'Democracy On The Streets'</li>
 			<li>the word 'Eternity'</li>
 			<li>the word 'Infinity'</li>
			<li>the pronoun 'MWe'</li>
			<li>InfinityDOTS (two dots, side by side, different colours)</li>
		</ul>
	<p>Sometime, somewhere, a single chalk dot might suffice.</p>
<h2>Why should I connect to Join the DOTS?</h2>
	<p>While <strong>Join the DOTS</strong> is iterative and evolving, certain qualities are inherent in its DNA.</p>
	<p><strong>Join the DOTS</strong>:
	<ul>
		<li>asserts and celebrates our fundamental freedom expression. </li>
		<li>seeks to expand democracy. </li>
		<li>is concerned with connecting, honouring and integrating the 'Me' and the 'We'. </li>
		<li>is non-violent. </li>
		<li>is dialogic.</li>
		<li>is rooted in community.</li>
		<li>is inclusive.</li>
		<li>celebrates free speech, creativity and imagination.</li>
		<li>encourages outreach, connection and transformation.</li></p>
	</ul>
		<p>If these values resonate with you, pick up chalk and <strong>Join the DOTS</strong>. </p>
	<p>MWe need you. Really.</p>
<h2>Who are MWe?</h2>
	<p><strong>Join The DOTS</strong> coalesced in the mind of a single individual (me) during a period of COVID
	lockdown. </p>
	<p>The moment of epiphany was realising DOTS was an acronym for Democracy On The Streets. </p>
	<p>This realisation has proven wildly generative,
	rewarding - and a little weird - ever since. </p>
	<p>While <strong>Join The DOTS</strong> surfaced in an individual mind, it is informed by a host of
	disparate interactions and perspectives. <p>William Gibson might call it a
	‘Branch Plant of MWe’. </p>
	<p>In any case, it is appropriate to say it is authored by MWe.</p>

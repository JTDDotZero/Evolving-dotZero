<p>Welcome to dotZero: groundZero for Join The DOTS: DemocracyOnTheStreets.
Join the DOTS is a distributed, chalk-based wellbeing movement advocating widespread, strategic
use of pavement chalk as a means to reclaim space for imagination and democratic interaction.
Join The DOTS considers all impulses to justice to be connected by a concern for
the self, or 'enlightened self-interest'. Join The DOTS celebrates neoroscientist Dan Siegel's neologism MWe.
MWe is a tight concept for communicating an expanded sense of self. It contains, and honours,
both the individual self (Me) and the social self (We). 'MWe' acknowledges that our connections
- to others, to nature, to the past and the future - are integral to, and profoundly protective of,
 our individual self. In acknowledging this interdependence, MWe makes it clear that each individual's
 personal wellbeing is intimately dependent on the greater wellbeing of the whole. The pursuit of
 universal justice becomes a matter of enlightened self-interest... MWe're new to coding
and going to try to build from the ground up. Call it 'slow coding'. There is much more to follow.
Please keep faith, and check back soon. In the meantime: MWe Need To Chalk.
If you have thoughts, comments, feedback or questions, MWe would love to
hear from you. Contact us by:

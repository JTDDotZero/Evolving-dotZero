<h1>Join The DOTS: Democracy On The Streets</h1>
<h2>Welcome to dotZero</h2>
	<p>dotZero is symbol and centre for <strong>Join The DOTS: Democracy On The Streets</strong>. </p>
	<p>Like <strong>Join The DOTS</strong>, dotZero is being built from the groud up. And Mwe're new to coding.</p>
	<p> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NMWAczkhGg" target="_blank">MWe</a>
	invite you to check in regularly. Contact details are provided below.</p>
 	<p>MWe also invite you to <strong><em>Join the DOTS</em></strong>. </p>
<h2>About <em>Join the DOTS</em></h2>
	<p><strong>Join The DOTS</strong> is emergent phenomenon. It is game-like, but resistant to categorisation.</p>
	<p>It can be described as a global, <strong>chalk-based</strong>, wellbeing movement, or collaboration.</p>
<h2>Purpose</h2>
	<p><strong>Join the DOTS</strong> seeks to expand available space for communication, expression and
	a reimagining of the self. </p>
	<p>In particular, <strong>Join The DOTS</strong> exists to provide ‘connective tissue’.
	<p> It offers a meaningful and inclusive framework for <strong>integrating</strong> the countless ways in which we
	each demand and create a more just, sustainable and satisfactory world.</p>
<h2>Rationale</h2>
	<p><strong>Join the DOTS</strong> recognises that the
		<a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2016/11/28/einstein-circles-of-compassion/" target="_blank">optical
	delusion</a> of a separated self, cut off from the rest of the universe, simply is not cutting it any more.</p>
	<p>Real world events demonstrate daily that our fates are intertwined and our individual and
	collective wellbeing are ultimately inseparable.</p>
	<p>Acknowledging this, it becomes apparaent our own <strong>personal</strong> wellbeing is dependent on <strong>global</strong>
	wellbeing.</p>
	<p>A world defined by justice, compassion and respect for 'others' becomes a matter of enlightened self-interest.</p>
	<p><strong>Join the DOTS</strong> believes that the frame of <em><strong>the self</strong></em> is expansive
	enough, meaningful enough, and resonant enough, to encompass <strong>all</strong> the myriad
demands for a just world.</p>
	<p>MWe believe a view of the self as 'Mwe', which balances and respects both the 'me' and the 'we' - will provides the necessary
	'germ' around which a new common-sense, or hegemony can rapidly coalesce.</p>
<h2>Method</h2>
	<p>The medium is the message. Pavement chalk is both practically and symbolically optimal as a
means of communication and to legitimately claim space.</p>
<h2>How To Play</h2>
	<p>Like all the best games, the rules are simple but the plays are infinite.</p>
		<ul>
 			<li>Play safe. Play social.</li>
 			<li>Chalk with an open heart and mind.</li>
 			<li>Use the simplest of chalks. Pavement chalk is ideal.</li>
			<li>Chalk openly. Claim your space.</li>
			<li>Include a Unifying Meme</li>
			<li>Whenever possible, leave some chalk behind. It's a conversation!</li>
		</ul>
<h2>Unifying Memes</h2>
	<p>The Unifying memes are those  symbols and phrases which, when inscribed in chalk, gently link any
	individual expression to the broader frame of <strong>Join the DOTS</strong>. </p>
	<p>Unifying memes include: </p>
		<ul>
 		 	<li>the dotZero symbol</li>
 			<li>the phrase 'Join the DOTS'</li>
			<li>the phrase 'Democracy On The Streets'</li>
 			<li>the word 'Eternity'</li>
 			<li>the word 'Infinity'</li>
			<li>the pronoun 'MWe'</li>
			<li>InfinityDOTS (two dots, side by side, different colours)</li>
		</ul>
	<p>Sometime, somewhere, a single chalk dot might suffice.</p>
<h2>Why should I connect to Join the DOTS?</h2>
	<p>While <strong>Join the DOTS</strong> is iterative and will evolve, certain values and
	goals are fundamentally encoded into its base DNA.</p>
	<p><strong>Join the DOTS</strong>:
	<ul>
		<li>asserts a universal right to the 'creative commons' </li>
		<li>seeks to expand democratic space. </li>
		<li>is concerned with connecting, honouring and integrating the 'Me' and the 'We'. </li>
		<li>uses chalk only (is non-violent). </li>
		<li>is dialogic.</li>
		<li>is rooted in community.</li>
		<li>is inclusive.</li>
		<li>celebrates free speech, creativity and imagination.</li>
		<li>encourages outreach, connection and transformation.</li></p>
	</ul>
		<p>If these values resonate with you, MWe invite to pick up chalk and <strong>Join the DOTS</strong>. </p>
	<p>MWe need you. Really.</p>
<h2>Who are MWe?</h2>
	<p><strong>Join The DOTS</strong> coalesced in the mind of a single individual (me) during a period of COVID
	lockdown. </p>
	<p>The moment of epiphany was realising DOTS was an acronym for Democracy On The Streets. </p>
	<p>This realisation opened the floodgates and the concept has been wildly generative,
	intrinsically rewarding, and kinda weird, ever since. </p>
	<p>While <strong>Join The DOTS</strong> surfaced in an individual mind, it is informed by a host of
	disparate interactions and perspectives. <p>William Gibson might call it a
	‘Branch Plant of MWe’. </p>
	<p>In any case, it is appropriate to say it belongs to, and is authored by, MWe.</p>

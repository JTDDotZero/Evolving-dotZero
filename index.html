<h1>Join The DOTS: Democracy On The Streets</h1>
<h2>Welcome to dotZero</h2>
	<p>dotZero is symbol and centre for <strong>Join The DOTS: Democracy On The Streets</strong>. </p>
	<p>Like Join The DOTS, dotZero is iterative and evolving.</p>
	<p>MWe invite you to check in regularly.</p>
 	<p>MWe also invite you to <strong>Join the DOTS</strong></p>
<h2>About Join the DOTS</h2>
	<p><strong>Join The DOTS</strong> is emergent phenomenon. It is game-like, but resistant to categorisation.</p>
	<p>It can be described as a global, chalk-based, wellbeing movement – or collaboration.</p>
<h2>Purpose</h2>
	<p><strong>Join the DOTS</strong> exists to expand available space for human voice and agency; dialogue;
	imagination; and, a fuller sense of ‘the self’. </p>
	<p>In particular, <strong>Join The DOTS</strong> seeks to provide ‘connective tissue’: to link the myriad
	actions to realise a more just, sustainable and satisfactory way of 'being' in the world,
	through an expanded sense of self and a subsequent shared perception of ‘enlightened
	self-interest’. </p>
<h2>Rationale</h2>
	<p><strong>Join the DOTS</strong> believes that the <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2016/11/28/einstein-circles-of-compassion/">optical
	delusion</a> of the self as separate from the rest of the universe simply does not cut it any more.</p>
	<p>It is now obvious and inescapable that our fates are intertwined and our individual and
	collective wellbeing are inseparable.</p>
	<p>From this it follows that a more just and equitable world is a matter of urgent self-interest
	for everybody.</p>
	<p><strong>Join the DOTS</strong> believes that <strong>this</strong> universal frame – of ultimate self-interest – is expansive
	enough, meaningful enough, and resonant enough, to encapsulate and connect all the myriad
	impulses to justice currently swirling throughout our world.</p>
	<p>MWe believe cultivating such a frame to connect all our efforts is both appropriate and
	essential to establishing a new common sense, or hegemony, capable of uniting and inspiring
	humanity to respond appropriately to our profound and existential challenges.</p>
<h2>Method</h2>
	<p>The medium is the message. Pavement chalk is both practically and symbolically optimal as a
means to communicate and legitimately claim space.</p>
<h2>How To Play</h2>
	<p>Like all the best games, the rules are simple but the plays are infinite.</p>
		<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
 			<li>Play safe. Play social.</li>
 			<li>Chalk with an open heart and mind.</li>
 			<li>Use the simplest of chalks. Pavement chalk is ideal.</li>
			<li>Chalk openly. Claim your space.</li>
			<li>Include a Unifying Meme</li>
			<li>Whenever possible, leave some chalk behind. It's a conversation!</li>
		</ul>
<h2>Unifying Memes</h2>
	<p>The Unifying memes are those  symbols and phrases which, when inscribed in chalk, gently link contextmenu=""any
	individual expression to the broader frame of <strong>Join the DOTS</strong>. </p>
	<p>Unifying memes include: </p>
		<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
 		 	<li>the dotZero symbol</li>
 			<li>the phrase 'Join the DOTS'</li>
			<li>the phrase 'Democracy On The Streets'</li>
 			<li>the word 'Eternity'</li>
 			<li>the word 'infinity'</li>
			<li>the pronound 'MWe'</li>
			<li>InfinityDOTS (two dots, side by side, different colours)</li>
		</ul>
	<p>Sometime, somewhere, a single chalk dot might suffice.</p>
<h2>Why should I connect to Join the DOTS?</h2>
	<p>While Join the DOTS is iterative, changeable and learning as it goes, certain values are
fixed deep into its DNA. These values speak to the self, non-violence, free expression, community,
	democracy, enquiry, outreach, connection and transformation.</p>
	<p>If these values resonate with you and describe the world you seek to realise, please <strong>Join the DOTS</strong>. </p>
	<p>MWe need you. Really.</p>
<h2>Who are MWe?</h2>
	<p>Join The DOTS coalesced in the mind of a single individual (me) during a period of COVID
	lockdown. </p>
	<p>The moment of epiphany was realising DOTS was an acronym for Democracy On The Streets. </p>
	<p>This realisation opened the floodgates and the concept has been wildly generative,
	intrinsically rewarding, and kinda weird, ever since. </p>
	<p>While <strong>Join The DOTS</strong> did indeed surface in my individual mind, it is informed by a host of
	disparate experiences and perspectives. William Gibson might consider it the product of a
	‘Branch Plant of MWe’. </p>
	<p>In any case, it is appropriate to say it belongs to, and is being authored by, MWe.</p>
	<p>MWe invite and encourage you to become a party to its further realisation.</p>
	<p>Pich up that chalk!</p>
